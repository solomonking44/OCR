DIGII SENTE APP TESTS
MAJOR

Issue#1 — CHANGE PIN

+ When the customer changes their PIN, it does not actually change

* When a customer tries to change their PIN and they enter the current PIN as the new one,
the app loads endlessly

+ When a customer does not enter their new PIN in the ‘Enter new PIN’ field, they can still
update their PIN by writing in the confirm new PIN field.

+ When the customer does not enter their new PIN but they write something in the confirm
field and delete there afterwards, the ‘update PIN’ button appears and it can be clicked

Issue#2 - WRONG PIN CAN BE USED TO LOGIN WHEN SESSION
EXPIRES

When a customer is logged in and their session to ends, they can write 4 random digits as the PIN
and they will be logged back in without validation.

Issue#3 - UMEME

response when the proceed button is pressed. An alert should be raised to info the customer that the
amount is insufficient
